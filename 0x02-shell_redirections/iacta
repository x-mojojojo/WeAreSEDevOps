Louis Profeta, used LinkedIn to post some articles around his book, The Patient in Room Nine Says He’s God, published in 2010. 
Sales had trickled down to single figures per month, with occasional boosts if the author had been active with TV or Radio. 
So he used the LinkedIn site to post some articles and this put him in front of the blogging community and the editors there. 
He chose a topic that was hot news in October 2014 – Ebola, and wrote a great article. 
His sales in the month following jumped to three figures. 
Although the sales dropped afterwards they didn’t disappear and Louis followed this article with a second in June 2014,

The editor of LinkedIn then decided that he would publish all of Louis’ articles. 
The latest such offering was January 2016, https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-know-you-love-me-... and the sales are now in five figures.
